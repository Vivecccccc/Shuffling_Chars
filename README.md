# Shuffling_Chars
As found in some linguistics studies, a shuffled order of Chinese characters within a compound word has limited disturbance on understanding a sentence, which is attributed to reader processing word at both word-wise and character-wise levels, followed by a restoration of appropriate character order. Inspired by this idea, we propose a self-supervised method based on BERT, by shuffling characters within a whole word segment and labelling each character with its correct position in a word. A Query-Key-Value attention mechanism is introduced for a sequence tagging task aiming at finding the correct position of each character, which is equivalent to the intuition of restoring the original Chinese word like human readers.
